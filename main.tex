\begin{abstract}
Recently, a number of studies have shown that cumulative mortality followed a Gompertz curve in the initial Coronavirus epidemic period, March-April 2020. 
We show that the Gompertz curve is incompatible with the traditional communicable disease spreading hypothesis, and propose a new theory which better explains the nature of the mortality characteristics based on an environmental stressor. 
Second, we show that for the Gompertz curve to emerge, the stressor has to act on everyone simultaneously, rejecting the possibility of a disease propagation stage. 
Third, we show that the population acts like a coherent organism under growth/depletion. 
Finally, we connect the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with our new theory and show that the SIR model is compatible with Gompertzian growth only when all nodes in the transmission network communicate with infinite speed and interaction.

\section{Introduction}
Traditional communicable disease spreading theory assumes a pathogen which infects the population through a network of transmission. 
Following this line of reasoning it can be theoretically shown that in the early stages of an epidemic, growth follows a logistic-like curve, where the very beginning exhibits exponential growth, and for which analytic and semi-analytic solutions have recently emerged \citep{harko2014exact,kroger2020analytical,schlickeiser2021analytical,heng2020approximately}. 
A large body of research has emerged that explores how these models fit the recent mortality seen due to the Coronavirus epidemic \citep{carletti2020covid,cooper2020sir,postnikov2020estimation,munoz2021sir,cooper2022dynamical,saikia2021covid}. 

However, instead of showing logistic-like growth, observed cumulative mortality in the initial period March-April 2020 exhibits almost perfect resemblance to Gompertzian growth \citep{Gompertz1825,bajzer1997mathematical} where the log-transformed cumulative mortality, or log-mortality for short, is exponentially \emph{decreasing} in time,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GompertzODE}
\frac{d}{dt}\ln{Y(t)} = -\beta\ln{\frac{Y(t)}{\tilde{Y}}} + \nu,
\end{equation} 
% Redundant definitions for full script
with constants $\tilde{Y}$, $\beta$, and $\nu$, and whose solution is given as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gomp_solution}
Y(t) = Y_\infty \left(\frac{Y_0}{Y_\infty}\right)^{e^{-\beta t}},
\end{equation}
where $Y_{0}=Y(t = 0)$ and $Y_{\infty}=Y(t\rightarrow \infty)=\tilde{Y}e^{\nu/\beta}$. 

% \insertSmallPdfFig{Gompertz_concept}{A conceptual display of the discrepancy seen between the logistic growth and the observations, superimposed by a Gompertz curve. Data is transformed to the straight line domain of the Gompertz curve for visual clarity, $f(Y)=\ln{\ln{1/Y}}$.}

This phenomenon is recorded by \citep{Ohnishi2020,Rypdal2020,Catala2020,rodrigues2020monte,Levitt2020}, showing Gompertz curves at national levels instead of the traditionally predicted logistic curves. What is causing such a discrepancy between reality and the current theory of communicable diseases \citep{castro2020turning}?

One could approach this conundrum from parametrization of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model under a time-dependent infection/recovery rate ratio, $\phi(t)$ \citep{kermack1927contribution}. How would $\phi(t)$ have to behave? Start by recalling the SIR model for a pool of susceptible people of size $N$ evolving between the three states: susceptible, $S(t)$, recovered, $R(t)$ and infected, $I(t)$,
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SIR}
\frac{dS}{dt}& = -\beta \frac{IS}{N}\\
\frac{dI}{dt}& = -\beta \frac{IS}{N} - \alpha I.\\
\frac{dR}{dt}& = \alpha I,
\end{align}
omitting the argument $t$ in each variable for brevity and where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in this context signify recovery and infection rates.

A line of reasoning employed by \citet{Rypdal2020} to obtain the Gompertz curve is to linearize the SIR model by assuming
both the number of infected, $I(t)$, and cumulative infected, $Y(t)$, is much less than the initial pool of susceptible people, $N \gg Y \ge I$, which seems well founded at the national level, viz.
\begin{align}
\label{eq:linSIR}
\frac{dY}{dt}& = \beta I\\
\frac{dI}{dt}& = (\beta - \alpha) I = \alpha (\phi(t) - 1) I,
\end{align}
and where the number of recovered, $R(t)$, is under this linearization decoupled from the other variables. 

They further assume the number of diseased is proportional to the number of cumulative infected, offset by a time lag, which allows us to use the same set of linearized equations to model the number of cumulative people diseased without loss of generality.

 Due to this linearization, the infection/recovery ratio, $\phi(t)$, will have to change as a function of time to accommodate for the boundary conditions. And since $I$ is a function of $Y$, we can combine (\ref{eq:linSIR}) via an instantaneous relative growth rate, $\gamma(t) = dY(t) /(Ydt) = \beta I / Y$, in turn parameterized by a scaling factor, $\theta$, representing the shape of the growth,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:rypdal}
\begin{align}
\frac{dY}{dt} =& \gamma(t) Y(t) \label{eq:rypdalODE}\\
\gamma(t) =& \frac{\gamma_{\infty}}{\theta}\left[1 - \left(\frac{Y}{Y_{\infty}}\right)^{\theta} \right] \label{eq:rypdalGamma},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\gamma_{\infty} = \gamma(t\rightarrow \infty)$. This parametrization is the commonly used Richard's growth curve \citep{richards1959flexible}, also called $\theta$-logistic growth, and has been used by others \citep{wu2020generalized}. Although not immediately justified in the communicable disease theory, one could imagine that $\theta$ represents non-linear network behavior \citep{petroni2020logistic}. Note that at $\theta=1$, the traditional logistic growth curve is obtained, while at $\theta\rightarrow \infty$ we recover the exponential (Malthusian) explosion.

The observed Gompertzian mortality curves are realized in the limit $\theta \rightarrow 0$, with the relative growth rate, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rypdalLimit}
\gamma(t) = \lim_{\theta \rightarrow 0}\frac{\gamma_{\infty}}{\theta}\left[1 - \left(\frac{Y}{Y_{\infty}}\right)^{\theta} \right]
= \gamma_{\infty}\ln{\frac{Y_{\infty}}{Y}}
\end{equation}

 At this limit the growth rate approaches infinity as $Y \rightarrow 0$, which seems odd under the hypothesis that the pathogen has just started spreading. 
 The Gompertzian limit also implies a decreasing relative growth rate from the very first time point, which under the SIR model seems unlikely given the large pool of susceptible people in the beginning. 
 One would rather expect a near-constant relative growth rate in the beginning due to a disease propagation stage. 
 \citet{Rypdal2020} suggest that the decreasing relative growth rate is caused by social and political mitigating efforts, but these hardly justify such coherent and consistent mortality characteristics across countries. 
 
 Perhaps a more likely scenario from which a Gompertz curve would emerge is the selective infection of central nodes in the transmission network resulting in an immediate decrease in relative growth. 
 On the other hand, an infection of peripheral nodes should cause immediate exponential growth. 
 \citet{herrmann2020covid} studied a networked SIR model on a variety of networks, but did not elaborate on a possible fit to a Gompertz curve. 
 Although it may be possible to realize Gompertzian growth from a special network, firm theoretical work has yet to be done to show this connection. 
 We will touch upon how the Gompertz curve emerges from one such network below, under some caveats.

\subsection{The SIR model family is almost Gompertzian}
Without the linearization and the somewhat arbitrary $\theta$-parametrization, one can still obtain from the communicable disease models growth which is almost Gompertzian, i.e. a straight line under a double-log transform of (\ref{eq:gomp_solution}), viz.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GOMP_D}
\ln{(\ln{(Y_{\infty}/Y)})} = -\beta t + k,
\end{equation}
with $k=\ln{\ln{\frac{Y_{\infty}}{Y_{0}}}}$. To show this, we follow \citet{carletti2020covid} and consider the extended version of the SIR the model by including a group of diseased, $D(t)$, such that $N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t) + D(t)$, also called the SIRD model. This requires an addition to our original set of equations (\ref{eq:SIR}), with a extra equation for the diseased group's growth at some rate $\delta$ relative to the current infected group,
\begin{equation}
\frac{dD}{dt} = \delta I.
\end{equation}

Some algebraic manipulations reveal that the diseased group is described by a single equation, viz.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SIRD_D}
\frac{dD}{dt} = \eta( 1 - e^{-\xi D}) - \kappa D,
\end{equation}
where $\eta = \delta N$, $\xi = \beta/(\delta N)$, $\kappa = \delta + \alpha$, and where $N$ is again synonymous to the initial susceptible pool of people. This pool of people cannot be obtained from deaths alone, but can be inferred by assuming a known ratio between mortality and recovery, $\delta$ and $\alpha$. 
When only modeling the diseased however, knowledge of $N$ is irrelevant and the three parameters in (\ref{eq:SIRD_D}) are sufficient.

Note here that small values of D follow logistic growth, viz.
\begin{equation}
\frac{dD}{dt} = b D (1 - D/K),
\end{equation}
obtained with a second order expansion of the exponential term in (\ref{eq:SIRD_D}) and with $b=\eta\xi - \kappa$ and $K=2b/\eta\xi^2$. The SIR and SEIR model exhibits similar properties and its discrepancy with initial observations related to the Coronavirus epidemic has been noted by others \citep{vattay2020forecasting}.

With the full 3-parameter single ODE of the diseased group in the SIRD model, one can obtain a curve quite close to a straight line in the double-log domain even in the initial observations, although there will always be a non-zero concavity (Fig. \ref{fig:Gompertz_vs_SIRD_lnln_infty} and Supplemental Information).
Meanwhile, even though the Gompertz model can be fit with a 3-parameter model as shown in (\ref{eq:GompertzODE}), it can also be simplified to a 2-parameter model estimated through linear regression of log-mortality,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GompertzODE2param}
\frac{d}{dt}\ln{Y(t)} = -\beta\left[\ln{Y(t)} - \ln {Y_{\infty}}\right].
\end{equation}
Thus, through linear regression estimates, the Gompertz model mitigates the possibility of non-identifiability issues of the parameters \citep{roda2020difficult}.

Note also that the SIRD model above considers average macroscopic behavior of an ensemble of microscopic units justified through mean-field theory \citep{smilkov2014beyond} which does not consider network effects explicitly. Rather, all entities are connected and communicating instantaneously as shown by \citet{mombach2002mean}.
However, even with such strong assumptions, it is odd that observed mortality never exhibits a stage of near-exponential growth as this macroscopic SIRD model predicts, but rather a constant negative slope in the double-log domain. 
We are thus prompted to look for another model which can explain the observed mortality patterns.

Both models are fit using non-linear least squares according to equations (\ref{eq:GompertzODE}) and (\ref{eq:SIRD_D}) in the text. Although the Gompertz curve can also be obtained with a simple linear fit using (\ref{eq:GompertzODE2param}), it is here obtained using non-linear least squares to put both models on equal footing. The temporal evolution of the SIRD model is obtained from the Runge-Kutta algorithm, while the Gompertz has a closed form for its temporal evolution. Each plot is annotated with an inferred transmission rate in the SIRD model with 1 standard deviation in brackets, assuming bi-normally distributed parameter estimates. Fitting is done with Python-Scipy and a 6-day windowed average of deaths.

\section{An alternative theory for observed mortality}
\label{seq:alt}
An alternative line of reasoning that does not rely on the framework of communicable diseases is that the biosphere was perturbed by an external stressor, initiating a stress response to eventually bring mortality rates back to stability. 
This could explain the immediate dampening of mortality growth observed. 
It could also explain the lack of correlation between population density and mortality (or infection) rates observed by some \citep{Hamidi2020,Hamidi2020a,Carozzi2020,Arpino2020,khavarian2021high,barak2021urban}.

Inspired by \citet{de2014stochastic}, the stressor can be modeled as a multiplicative stochastic dampening term along with a countering force of the immune system. 
As with all multiplicative processes, it is convenient to log-transform mortality and work in a dimensionless space such that $F(t)=Y(t)/Y_\infty$ and $Z(t)=\ln{F}(t)$, from which a natural perturbation model emerges,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:microscopic}
dZ(t)= -\beta Z(t) dt + \sqrt{\sigma}dW(t),
\end{equation}
where $dW(t)$ is a delta-correlated Wiener process with zero mean, making $Z(t)$ a stochastic process. The first term on the right hand side represents the growth due to the stressor, while the second represents the stress response.  

This perturbation model is called an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process \citep{risken1996fokker}. It is also interpreted as Newton's equation of motion with friction and a random force (Langevin's equation), and a continuous version of an Auto-Regressive(1) model \citep{akaike1970statistical}. The diffusion coefficient, $\sigma$, represents the strength of the perturbation, which we directly see if we recast this equation in terms of mortality while introducing a new parameter $K=\exp{(-\frac{\sigma}{2\beta})}$, viz. 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:microscopicOriginal}
dF(t) = \left\{\frac{\sigma}{2}F(t) - \beta F(t)\ln\left[\frac{F(t)}{K}\right]\right\}dt + \sqrt{\sigma}F(t)dW(t).
\end{equation}



To obtain the deterministic observable, we first take the average in the log-domain (\ref{eq:microscopic}) and transform back to the original domain, 
\begin{equation}
d\langle\ln{F(t)}\rangle = -\beta \langle\ln{F(t)}\rangle dt,
\end{equation}
where the bra-ket notation signifies the averaging operation.
Then we use the property that the average of log-quantities is the logarithm of the median quantity, where we denote the median of $F(t)$ as $M(t)$, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:medianGomp}
d\ln{M(t)} = -\beta \ln{M(t)} dt,
\end{equation}
which corresponds with the familiar deterministic Gompertz differential equation in (\ref{eq:GompertzODE}) with $Y(t) = Y_\infty M(t)$. 
Comparing the stochastic stressor $\sigma$ in \ref{eq:microscopicOriginal} with the deterministic growth equation in (\ref{eq:GompertzODE}) gives $\nu=\sigma/2$, suggesting that the stressor is indeed the source of growth, while $\beta$ is the growth-limiting factor. 
We also see that by comparing (\ref{eq:rypdalODE}) and (\ref{eq:rypdalLimit}) with the stochastic counterpart in (\ref{eq:microscopicOriginal}) that the final growth level is governed by the stressor magnitude,
\begin{equation}
\sigma = 2\gamma_{\infty}\ln{Y_{\infty}}.
\end{equation}

Thus, a more parsimonious interpretation of the observations not reliant on a transmission network is that mortality was caused by a planetary perturbation, modeled as a random process, to which organisms gradually develop resistance at a geometric rate in the log-transformed domain \citep{boxenbaum2017hypotheses,neafsey1988gompertz}, which is the natural transformation for many processes in nature \citep{zhang1994log}. 
Under this model, the distribution of the abundance of $F(t)$ is log-normal, a result that can be obtained by directly solving the stochastic equation in (\ref{eq:microscopicOriginal}) \citep{skiadas2010exact,petroni2020gompertz}, or from thermodynamic principles \citep{sitaram1984statistical,gunasekaran1982lon,chakrabarti1996non}. 
Intuitively, this is seen by noting that the solution to the perturbation model in the log-domain (\ref{eq:microscopic}) is Gaussian in the variable $Z(t)$, thus suggesting a log-normal distribution of $F(t)$. This implies that the log-domain is the domain in which the central limit theorem applies.

\section{Unifying the SIR model and the Gompertz model}
The remarkable observation that the log-transformed domain is the natural one merits closer study. First, juxtapose the logistic model with the Gompertz model,

\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\dot{M} = \frac{d}{dt}M(t) & = \beta M(t) (1-M(t)) \quad \text{Logistic}\label{eq:compareLog}\\ 
\frac{d}{dt}\ln{(M(t))} & = -\beta \ln{(M(t)}) \quad\quad\text{Gompertz}\label{eq:compareGom},
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $M(t)$ is deterministic. 

In the logistic model, we recognize the rightmost side of the logistic equation as the transmission term in an SIR model, but also as a linear interaction term between the two macroscopic states. 
As mentioned earlier, this procedure is a mean field approximation with an implied average interaction between the variables. 
Thus, all dynamics are governed by macroscopic deterministic variables parametrized by a transmission rate.

A microscopic solution could be modeled by splitting the system into $N$ microscopic deterministic units, $M(t) \rightarrow x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_N(t)$, where the lower case $x_i$ emphasizes the microscopic quality of the variables, and is here interpreted as probability of infection. From these microscopic units, macroscopic growth could be obtained by taking their arithmetic average,
\begin{equation}
M(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i^N x_i(t).
\end{equation}
Naturally, this simple arithmetic average treats each microscopic unit as independent variables contributing to the macroscopic observable.

One could add network interaction necessitating a corresponding matrix version of (\ref{eq:compareLog})
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:networkSIR}
\frac{d x_i}{dt} = \beta (1-x_i)\sum_j{a_{ij}}x_j \quad \forall i,
\end{equation}
using the shorthanded $x_i=x_i(t)$ and with a fixed correlation governed by the network's growth rate, $\beta$, and adjacency matrix, $\{a_{i,j}\}=\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$, a binary matrix with ones where the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ nodes are connected, and zeroes otherwise. Notice that there is an implied causality going from the infected to susceptible, which will become relevant below. Furthermore, a linear correlation between variables is seen as the partial derivatives of the instantaneous growth rate with respect to pairs of microscopic variables,
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 \dot{M}}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} = -\frac{\beta}{N} a_{i,j}.
\end{equation}
Still, no Gompertz curve will emerge at the onset of the growth process. \citet{estrada2022networked} provide illuminating analysis on this topic.

In contrast, as discussed in Section \ref{seq:alt}, the Gompertz model is implied by a multiplicative stochastic process with a log-normal distribution in its abundance at any given point in time. As mentioned earlier, this implies that the log-domain is the natural domain in which the central limit theorem applies, thus implying correlated mortality growth through the geometric mean,

\begin{equation}
M(t) = \exp \left[\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \ln x_i(t)\right] = \left[\prod_i x_i (t)\right]^{\frac{1}{N}}
\end{equation} 

Under this model, correlation between entities is present at all orders in the original domain and all the nodes in the network communicate instantaneously\footnote{It is illuminating to at this point compare with Gompertz' Law of Mortality, $\frac{d}{dt}\ln{(1 - M(t))} = -\beta$, for $t$ more than ~25 years, which yields a naturally uncorrelated macroscopic curve $1 - M(t) = \exp{(-\beta t)}$ \citep{shklovskii2005simple}. 
In our context, the uncorrelated feature emerges since the force of mortality is not a function of the growth itself, as we see in the text, but rather of time.}.

Thus, the emergence of the Gompertz curve at the macroscopic level suggests that the system is correlated, or coherent, presumably as a result of the simultaneous exposure to the same underlying stressor, but also due to the implied log-normal nature of the microscopic entities, where multiplication replaces addition as the aggregating operator \citep{zhang1994log}.
We can now further appreciate Richard's parametrization as a transition from non-collaborative to collaborative growth as $\theta \rightarrow 0$. 
This feature of $\theta$ was also obtained by \citet{petroni2020logistic} by interpreting the $\theta-$logistic growth rate in (\ref{eq:rypdal}) as non-linear resource availability dependent on the overall magnitude, $Y(t)$, with growth at $\theta \rightarrow 0$ named ``maximally coherent''. 
\citet{molski2003coherent} made a similar observation that Gompertzian growth is the coherent state in a quantum mechanical system with a time-dependent potential, an interpretation which sheds further light on the temporal nature of the postulated stress response.
This quantum mechanical system has also been used to describe coherent energy states of diatomic molecules in space \citep{morse1929diatomic}. 
In the field of quantum physics, \emph{coherence} is a well-defined mathematical property first explored by \citet{glauber1963coherent} in the context of electromagnetic fields. The fact that we observe the Gompertz curve in both the microscopic quantum scales and the macroscopic national scales is noteworthy, and suggests that both systems share commonalities and means of communication.

\subsection{Unification through a modified SIR model}
However, it is possible to reconcile the SIR model with the Gompertz curve. 
Inspired by the observation that in the linearized approximation there are only two coupled states, infected and susceptible, we augment the interaction term to higher orders. 
Then, we reverse the causality where the population of infected are now dependent on the population of the susceptible instead of the other way around as in (\ref{eq:networkSIR}),
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reverseNetworkSIR}
\frac{d x_i}{dt} = \beta x_i\sum_j{a_{ij}}(1-x_j) \quad \forall i.
\end{equation} 
This crucial change is based on the environmental stressor hypothesis rather than a communicable disease assumption.
Furthermore, we will for the sake of simplicity assume all nodes in the network have exactly one neighbor and that there exists a unique path between all nodes,
\begin{equation}
\sum_i a_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j.
\end{equation} 
If we let $s_i = 1 - x_i$ be the probability of being susceptible, the augmented and causality-reversed SIR model infection term becomes 
\begin{equation}
\frac{d x_i}{dt} = \beta x_i\sum_j{a_{ij}}(s_{j} + s^2_j/2 + ...) - \alpha x_i\quad \forall i,
\end{equation}

Now use the Taylor series $s+s^2/2+... = -\ln(1-s)$, viz.

\begin{equation}
\frac{d x_i}{dt} = -\beta x_i\sum_j{a_{ij}}\ln{(1 - s_j)} - \alpha = -\beta x_i\sum_j{a_{ij}}\ln{x_j} - \alpha x_i \quad \forall i,
\end{equation}
As we are interested in the aggregate macroscopic behavior, we take averages in the log domain, exploit our setup where $\mathbf{A}$ is a single mapping from one node to another, and simplify to
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{{dt}} \ln\left[\prod_i{x_i}\right]^{\frac{1}{N}} = -\beta\ln\left[\prod_i{x_i}\right]^{\frac{1}{N}} - \alpha.
\end{equation}
If $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, then this equation will exhibit Gompertzian growth in the geometric ensemble average of microscopic units. 
An interpretation of $\alpha\rightarrow 0$ could be that the limiting factor emerges purely from the growth rate without the need for a second growth-limiting parameter, in line with the previous crucial hypothesis of causality reversal stated above. One further simplification could be seen in equating the logarithm of the geometric mean with the logarithm of the median of the set of $x_i$ to obtain (\ref{eq:medianGomp}),
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\ln{M(t)} = -\beta \ln{M(t)}.
\end{equation}



\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we have shown that Gompertzian growth follows from infinite interactions between the susceptible and infected states, and that the perceived pathogen travels at infinite speed throughout the population, rejecting the possibility of a disease propagation stage through a perceived transmission network. In this vein, Richard's parameter, $\theta$, can be related to the number of higher order interactions with the susceptible and the infected in an SIR model \citep{richards1959flexible}, where infinite interactions corresponds to $\theta\rightarrow 0$. 

We further show that the observed mortality across countries can be explained by a model where the biological system is stressed by a ubiquitous and simultaneous stressor eliciting a corresponding stress response through which gradual return to pre-epidemic conditions are mediated. The stressor is modeled as a stochastic perturbation in the log-transformed domain of effects where correlation between people or microscopic entities is present at all orders. From this model, we draw parallels between the coherent behavior of the population's mortality evolution during an epidemic and the spatial coherence of quantum mechanical systems, borrowing the definition of coherence from quantum physics \citep{molski2003coherent}.

Thus, we see growth on a spectrum: In one extreme we find non-collaborative growth models or models with parameterized linear interaction effects, and in the other extreme we see a field of microscopic entities coherently sharing information much like quantum entangled particles. The emergence of coherent quantum phenomena at the macroscopic level suggests that no longer can the microscopic world claim a monopoly on quantum physics, especially as it relates to biology \citep{lambert2013quantum}. One might be surprised to find that temporal evolution of human mortality during epidemics can behave like the spatial energy distribution of quantum coherent systems.

The transmission rate is modeled as the product of $\eta \xi$ in (\ref{eq:SIRD_D}), and its associated variance is obtained assuming a bi-normal relationship between the two parameters with cross-correlation $\rho$ \citep{nadarajah2016distribution},
\begin{equation}
\text{Var}[\beta] = \text{Var}[\eta] \text{Var}[\xi] (1 + \rho^2) + \text{Var}[\xi]*\text{E}[\eta]^2 + \text{Var}[\eta] \text{E}[\xi]^2,
\end{equation}
where estimates are obtained by substituting the model parameters with those estimated through the technique outlined above.

\section*{Supplement}

% Estimating the parameters using real data requires some consideration around the variance of the growth variable as a function of time. This variance will in turn inform the estimation process by considering a weighted minimization of the residuals of the observations regressed onto the model. In the stochastic Gompertz process postulated in Section \ref{seq:alt}, the process under a log-transformation is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process which has a closed from expression for its transition probability, and thus its variance as a function of time. This variance can then be used in a weighted least squares estimation technique or any other weighted technique. In the original domain there is also a closed form expression available but it is somewhat more convoluted and given that observations in this domain are visually quite homoscedastic with equal variance across time (Fig \ref{fig:Gompertz_vs_SIRD} and Tables \ref{tab:gomp} and \ref{tab:sird}), this is expression and consideration is omitted. But for the log-domain, observations exibit changing variance with time. 

% To be explicit, if we consider the notation from Section \ref{seq:alt} and let $P(z, t|z', t')$ be the transition probability from some growth and time coordinate $z', t'$ to some other growth and time coordinate $z, t$, than the transition probability of the Olstein-Uhlenbeck process in \ref{eq:microscopic} is given by\citep{risken1996fokker},
% \begin{equation}
% P(z, t|z', t') = \sqrt{\frac{\beta}{2\pi \sigma (1 - e^{-2\beta (t-t')})}}\exp{\left[ -\frac{\beta (z - e^{-\beta(t-t')}z')^2}{2\sigma(1-e^{-2 \beta(t-t')})} \right]}.
% \end{equation}

% If we consider $t$ the time at which the stationary distribution is reached and that this stationary distribution is given as a delta function, variance of the growth will be given as
% \begin{equation}
% \text{Var[Z(t)|t']} = \sigma(1-e^{-2 \beta(t-t')}).
% \end{equation}

% Because weights on observations in a regression are invariant to multiplication we can let $\sigma=1$. The slope coefficient would have to be estimated either by a standard least squares or through the 3-parameter model in (\ref{eq:GompertzODE}).
