Highlights
----------
1. Recently observed mortality patterns of the initial Coronavirus pandemic in March-April 2020 exhibit Gompertzian growth.
2. Gompertzian growth is shown to be incompatible with traditional communicable disease spreading models.
3. An alternative model through which an environmental stressor elicits a mutual stress response is introduced.
4. For the Gompertz curve to emerge, the stressor has to act on everyone simultaneously, rejecting the possibility of a disease propagation stage. 
5. The population at risk acts like a coherent organism under growth/depletion similar to quantum coherent systems.
