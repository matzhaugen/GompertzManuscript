Kroger and Schlickeiser discuss well approximated analytic solutions to the SIR model, showing symmetric infection rates in all cases.
They also show the non-identifiability of infection rates and recovery rates.

Roda et al 2020 expose challenges in using SIR models to predict the cases. They also show the non-identifiability.

Estrada and Bartesaghi show that a networked SIS model is upper bounded by a Gompertz model.

Levitt et al argue that the covid pandemic follows a Gompertz model

Rypdal and Rypdal:
Show that the limit of an SIR model is Gompertz along with fits of a variety of countries. 
They do not justify why the nu factor which in the limit creates a Gompertz should go to zero.
This indeed corresponds to a situation where growth rate is infinite at J=0 (zero cases), and 
decreases exponentially onwards.

- There exists a very close link between the Gompertz equation and the allometry [6,28]. 
In fact, the Gompertz equation exhibits properties of allometric invariance. 
If s(t) is any solution of the Gompertz equation (20), then sb(t), with b any real number, is again a solution (in particular, the inverse of a solution is a solution, and corresponds to the inverted growth).

- This standard equation, that defines a geometric Brownian process, is nothing but that defining the
stochastic Gompertz model, already introduced and investigated in Refs. [13,14]. 
In these articles, the randomness is supposed to be generated by more or less intense environmental fluctuations, and its intensity is expressed by the diffusion
coefficient.

An alternative representation is that mortality rates follow an ornstein-uhlenbeck process where the random noise (stochstic) term represents the environmental disturbance and the exponential (Maltheusian) term represents the countering gradual buildup of immunity, until a stationary state is reached.
